Dr. Ryan is an Instructor of Biostatistics at the University of Pennsylvania, working primarily with the Penn Statistics in Imaging and Visualization Endeavor (PennSIVE). Prior to her current position, she worked as a graduate research assistant at National Jewish Health and the University of Colorado, graduating with a PhD in Biostatistics in Summer 2020. She has over six years of statistical and data analysis experience, with special emphasis on statistical and machine-learning methodologies for medical imaging data. She has developed user-friendly software for processing and analysis of computed tomography (CT) scans of the lung, including software for lung segmentation, template creation and radiomic analyses. Additionally, she has research interests in spatial modeling of the lung and medical image clustering analyses utilizing deep learning. Outside of research, she enjoys spending time with her family and friends, and various activities, including hiking, skiing, volleyball and ping pong.
