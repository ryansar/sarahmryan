I am an instructor of biostatistics at the Penn Statistics in Imaging and Visualization Endeavor (PennSIVE) within the Center for Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. Previously, I was a graduate student in biostatistics at the Colorado School of Public Health at the Anschutz Medical Campus, where I received my PhD in August of 2020. My disciplinary research is largely focused in the development of statistical methodologies and software packages for medical imaging data, specifically computed tomography scans of the lungs. Outside of research, I enjoy spending time with my family and friends, and various activities, including hiking, skiing, volleyball and ping pong.
