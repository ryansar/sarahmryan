abstract: Many interventions have been conducted to improve young children’s liking and consumption of new foods however their impacts on children’s consumption have been limited. Consistent evidence supports the use of repeated exposure to improve liking for new foods however longitudinal effects lasting greater than 6 months often have not been demonstrated. Here we report the eating-related findings of the Colorado Longitudinal Eating And Physical Activity (LEAP) Study, a multi-component intervention, delivered primarily in the school setting, which aimed to improve children’s liking and consumption of a target food via repeated exposure and positive experiential learning.
